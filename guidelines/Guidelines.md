# Astra UI Design System

`@brettmcm/astraui` is a React component library built with Tailwind CSS v4. Components are pre-styled with design tokens and ship with compiled CSS.

## ⚠ Critical Design Rules

Before building any screen, apply these mandatory rules:

1. **Every desktop page MUST include `SidebarNavigation`** — no exceptions (settings, empty states, errors, onboarding, dashboards, editors).
2. **`brand-tertiary` is the page background canvas.** The main content area next to the sidebar MUST use `bg-brand-tertiary`. This subtle lavender (#eaeaff) is what makes every screen feel like Astra.
3. **`surface-bg` is for elevated content on top of the canvas.** Cards, panels, form containers, and content sections use `surface-bg` — they float on the branded background to create hierarchy.
4. **Navigation hierarchy: SidebarNavigation → SecondaryNav → Tabs.** Primary nav is the sidebar (always present). Secondary nav is `SecondaryNav` (for pages with sub-sections like Settings). Tertiary nav is `Tabs` (only inside the main content area). Never use Tabs for secondary navigation — use SecondaryNav instead.
5. **Keep it minimal and clean.** The branded canvas provides identity. Everything on top should be simple, quiet, and restrained. Do not use dark or saturated brand colors as backgrounds on content areas.

## Available Exports

Every component and utility exported by `@brettmcm/astraui` is listed below. **Only these names can be imported from the package — do not attempt to import anything else.**

```tsx
// Components
import {
  AstraLogo,
  Avatar,
  AvatarGroup,
  Badge,
  Button,
  ButtonGroup,
  ChatBubbles,
  Checkbox,
  DurationBadge,
  FavoriteButton,
  InputField,
  ItemCard,
  Modal,
  SecondaryNav,
  SecondaryNavItem,
  PromptInput,
  PromptPane,
  RadioGroup,
  SearchComponent,
  SegmentedControl,
  SelectField,

  SidebarNavigation,
  SwitchField,
  Tabs,
  TextareaField,
  ThemeProvider,
  Toast,
  Toolbar,
  ToolbarItem,
  Tooltip,
  VideoControl,
} from '@brettmcm/astraui'

// Hooks
import { useTheme } from '@brettmcm/astraui'

// Utility
import { cn } from '@brettmcm/astraui'

// Icons — always use lucide-react, NOT @brettmcm/astraui
import { Search, Home, Settings } from 'lucide-react'
```

## Setup

```tsx
// Styles are auto-imported when you import any component.
// No additional CSS import or Tailwind configuration is needed.
import { Button, Avatar, Badge } from '@brettmcm/astraui'
```

If styles aren't loading, explicitly import:
```tsx
import '@brettmcm/astraui/styles.css'
```

**Do NOT add `@source` rules for this package in the consumer's Tailwind config.** The package ships pre-compiled CSS with all required utility classes.

## Styling Approach

- **Tailwind CSS v4** with `@theme inline` for token mapping
- **`cn()` utility** (exported) merges class names safely using `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`
- Components accept `className` prop for overrides
- Dark mode: add `.dark` class to `<html>` element (or use the `ThemeProvider`)

## Icons

**Always import icons from `lucide-react`.** Do not import icons from `@brettmcm/astraui`.

```tsx
import { Search, Home, Settings, ChevronDown, Plus, Trash2 } from 'lucide-react'
```

All Lucide icons accept: `size` (default 24), `color` (default `"currentColor"`), `strokeWidth` (default 2), `className`.

## Build

- **Bundler:** Vite with `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin
- **Library build:** `npm run build:lib` — outputs ESM (.mjs), CJS (.cjs), and pre-compiled CSS
- **CSS is pre-compiled** — consumers do NOT need Tailwind configured to use this package
